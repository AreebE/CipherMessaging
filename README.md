# CipherMessaging

A simple app for texting another user. Done using the Firebase Database provided by Google.

The first screen that pops up upon opening the app is a login screen, where you enter the username and password of this account. If have not made an account, then you can create a user by clicking on the upper right.

This opens a bar where you can put in a username and a password. Keep in mind that no two users can have the same username. After clicking create, a user will be created and you can log in.


After logging in, you will see a list of contacts. If you have none, then this will appear blank. You can add a conversation by clicking the upper right corner, where another input will be shown.

As noted here, you put in the title of the conversation and the other user you want to share the conversation with. If no such user exists, then you will be notified.

To open a conversation, simply tap on it. After a second or two, it will open up the conversation display.
